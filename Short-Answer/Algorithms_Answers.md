## Exercise I

a) O(n) The reason that I believe that this is O(n) is because it's only looping once or "n". For example, if n = 2, then it would loop only until a is greater than 8. Then a = 4 the first time, 8 the next time, and 12 the third time. This would mean this only loops twice and because it's only looping "n" times, this leads me to believe that it's O(n).


b)  O(n logn) Two nested loops, with the outer loop logarithmic â†’ logn and the inner loop is linear O(n)


c) The function is calling itself down to the base case. Assume "bunnies" = 10, and since we're subtracting bunnies-1 on each recursive call, it will call itself 10 times when it reaches that base case so this is still pretty linear and thus is O(n).
